Q | A ->

0   1  
1   1
2   1
3   1



Input: 

[0, 1] => [-1, 1]

User_a | User_b

   -1     -1
   -1     1    } If got along well, then output should be 1, 0 if not.
   1      1
   -1     1
   1     -1

Then we train network to predict 0, 1 given two user answer vectors.

Idea: Convnet for first layer??
